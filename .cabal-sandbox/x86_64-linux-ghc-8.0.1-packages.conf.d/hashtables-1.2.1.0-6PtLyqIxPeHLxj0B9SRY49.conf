synopsis: Mutable hash tables in the ST monad
description:
    This package provides a couple of different implementations of mutable hash
    tables in the ST monad, as well as a typeclass abstracting their common
    operations, and a set of wrappers to use the hash tables in the IO monad.
    .
    /QUICK START/: documentation for the hash table operations is provided in the
    "Data.HashTable.Class" module, and the IO wrappers (which most users will
    probably prefer) are located in the "Data.HashTable.IO" module.
    .
    This package currently contains three hash table implementations:
    .
    1. "Data.HashTable.ST.Cuckoo" contains an implementation of \"cuckoo
    hashing\" as introduced by Pagh and Rodler in 2001 (see
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo_hashing>). Cuckoo hashing has
    worst-case /O(1)/ lookups and can reach a high \"load factor\", in which
    the table can perform acceptably well even when approaching 90% full.
    Randomized testing shows this implementation of cuckoo hashing to be
    slightly faster on insert and slightly slower on lookup than
    "Data.Hashtable.ST.Basic", while being more space efficient by about a
    half-word per key-value mapping. Cuckoo hashing, like the basic hash
    table implementation using linear probing, can suffer from long delays
    when the table is resized.
    .
    2. "Data.HashTable.ST.Basic" contains a basic open-addressing hash table
    using linear probing as the collision strategy. On a pure speed basis it
    should currently be the fastest available Haskell hash table
    implementation for lookups, although it has a higher memory overhead
    than the other tables and can suffer from long delays when the table is
    resized because all of the elements in the table need to be rehashed.
    .
    3. "Data.HashTable.ST.Linear" contains a linear hash table (see
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_hashing>), which trades some insert
    and lookup performance for higher space efficiency and much shorter
    delays when expanding the table. In most cases, benchmarks show this
    table to be currently slightly faster than @Data.HashTable@ from the
    Haskell base library.
    .
    It is recommended to create a concrete type alias in your code when using this
    package, i.e.:
    .
    > import qualified Data.HashTable.IO as H
    >
    > type HashTable k v = H.BasicHashTable k v
    >
    > foo :: IO (HashTable Int Int)
    > foo = do
    >     ht <- H.new
    >     H.insert ht 1 1
    >     return ht
    .
    Firstly, this makes it easy to switch to a different hash table implementation,
    and secondly, using a concrete type rather than leaving your functions abstract
    in the HashTable class should allow GHC to optimize away the typeclass
    dictionaries.
    .
    This package accepts a couple of different cabal flags:
    .
    * @unsafe-tricks@, default /ON/. If this flag is enabled, we use some
    unsafe GHC-specific tricks to save indirections (namely @unsafeCoerce#@
    and @reallyUnsafePtrEquality#@. These techniques rely on assumptions
    about the behaviour of the GHC runtime system and, although they've been
    tested and should be safe under normal conditions, are slightly
    dangerous. Caveat emptor. In particular, these techniques are
    incompatible with HPC code coverage reports.
    .
    * @sse42@, default /OFF/. If this flag is enabled, we use some SSE 4.2
    instructions (see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4>, first available on
    Intel Core 2 processors) to speed up cache-line searches for cuckoo
    hashing.
    .
    * @bounds-checking@, default /OFF/. If this flag is enabled, array accesses
    are bounds-checked.
    .
    * @debug@, default /OFF/. If turned on, we'll rudely spew debug output to
    stdout.
    .
    * @portable@, default /OFF/. If this flag is enabled, we use only pure
    Haskell code and try not to use unportable GHC extensions. Turning this
    flag on forces @unsafe-tricks@ and @sse42@ /OFF/.
    .
